**REACT**
**Overview**
This project is a basic React application that uses JSX to create a simple UI with reusable components. It demonstrates the power of React components, prop passing, and state management using functional components and hooks.

**Features**
Reusable Components: Components like Username, UserProfile, and UserFavoriteFoods help keep the code modular and organized.
JSX Syntax: JSX (JavaScript XML) allows HTML-like syntax within JavaScript to create React elements, making the UI structure easy to read and maintain.
Functional Components: The project uses functional components, which are simple and concise.
Props: Data is passed between components using props for flexibility and reusability.
